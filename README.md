# Newton's method in MIPS assembly
The source contains an iterative Newton's method implementation in MIPS assembly.

## Task
The task was to implement the newton method to solve zeros of a polynomial function.

## Run it
If you want to run or edit the source, you should download [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/) (_MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator_).

> MARS is a lightweight interactive development environment (IDE) for programming in MIPS assembly language, intended for educational-level use with Patterson and Hennessy's Computer Organization and Design.

Just load `newton_method.s` and execute it by assembling and running it.
